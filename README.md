# fruityclothes
This plugin adds the clothes from my HL2TS2 overhaul model pack. It offers my own base that allows for easier customization of TS2 clothing items, as well as some more features (armor, protection, clothing quality and more) - thanks to Gr4Ss for some base code concerning some of those features.
